    <p class="mainp">My favorite hobby is fitness but really triathlons. For those that donâ€™t follow the sport, it is now an Olympic
        event. It starts with a 1.5K open water swim, transitions to a 40K bike ride and finishes with a 10K run.
        There are longer and shorter distance races. You may have heard of an ironman competition. Those events consume most
        of the day ( a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride and you finish with a full 26.2 mile marathon run).<a href="https://www.ironman.com/im-world-championship-kona.html/" target="_blank">Hawaiian Ironman</a>
        The Ironman World Championships is located in Hawaii during October each year.</p>

    <p class="swimp">My favorite part of the race is the open water swim (side note - I did not learn how to swim until after college.)

    <p class="bikep"> My least favorite part of the race is the bike ride. It is the most difficult part of the race for me and typically takes the longest</p>

    <p class="runp"> Even though running is at the end when everyone is most tired, I do my best at the running portion.</p>
